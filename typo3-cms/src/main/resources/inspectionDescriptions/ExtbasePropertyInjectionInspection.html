Property injection uses reflection to insert dependencies, which is inherently slower than a setter method. <br>
The alternative to property injection is setter-injection. <br>
You should much rather use setter-injection: <br>

<pre>
    protected $myService;

    public function injectMyService(MyService $myService) {
        $this->myService = $myService;
    }
</pre>
</body>
